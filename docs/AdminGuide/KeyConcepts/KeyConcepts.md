# Key Concepts

This section contains the Hyperledger Fabric **concepts** that you'll find really helpful if you're an Administrator. There are lots of new ideas to understand, but each one is quite straightforward, and you'll see that each idea falls under one of three categories, which makes it easy to understand why a concept exists.

If you're new to blockchain, it probably makes sense to read all of this material, but don't worry if you don't understand every detail - you'll be able to solidify your knowledge with the [DRIVENET sample](../DriveNetSample/DriveNetSample.md).

Finally, this section is conceptual - you won't see lots of commands to type, or detailed reference material - that will all come later. For now, focus on the ideas and why they are important. And remember, to make it easy to grasp these concepts we're going to explain them in the context of a real world sample called [DRIVENET](../HowOrganized/DriveNetSampleNetwork.md#the-drivenet-scenario).  If you haven't read this section yet, then it's worth doing that before you proceed!
